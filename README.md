Mizuki is an animator and video maker who uploads music videos online. They were captivated by Kanade's music upon listening to it, and made an MV for the song. Kanade invited Mizuki to 25-ji, Nightcord de. after seeing this video.

Since Junior High, Mizuki was treated as an outcast for dressing and acting oddly. Mizuki expresses confusion over their criticism, seeing nothing wrong with wanting to dress cute. It's implied they do not attend school regularly due to the negative attention from their classmates. Because of this reputation, Mizuki spent their time on the rooftop, where they met Rui, one of their only friends before becoming part of Nightcord.

Mizuki's older sister is a fashion designer living overseas, and inspired Mizuki's love of fashion.

As a first year, Mizuki was classmates with An in class 1-A. As a second year, they are classmates with Toya in class 2-B.
Mizuki has light pink eyes and hair, slightly curled and worn in a side ponytail tied with a ribbon. Two even strands of hair are let loose, framing their face. They have pale skin and wear pink mascara. Their voice is powerful androgynous. In their unit outfit, they wear a black sailor uniform. The collar of their uniform is light gray with a black-and-pink ribbon. They wear a gray striped skirt, ruffled with frills and lace on the hem of the skirt. The outer layer of the skirt is held at the left side with a ribbon, exposing the inner layers of the skirt. They wear thigh-high black socks, as well as strappy black heeled shoes.

Their casual outfit consists of a knee-length blue-gray pleated skirt with two frills on each side and suspender straps, leading to a loose, off-white, button-up, peasant top. Their hair is held up with a black bow, and uses a similar-looking ribbon as a bow tie, with the brand "CubeRouge" written along one of the strands in gold.
Mizuki is a moody person, and Kanade thinks they only act on their own principles. They tend to get frustrated and upset when ridiculed, and strongly desire to express themselves freely, without holding back or being made fun of.

Despite their energetic, carefree, and sometimes childish demeanor, Mizuki is often shown to be the most mature member of their circle, as Ena admits. [citation needed] They often assume the role of mediator in arguments, breaking things up between Mafuyu and Ena. Mizuki has a strong desire to express themselves freely, without holding back or being made fun of. They have an obsession with cute things, expressing it through their hand-altered fashion.

Mizuki is great at understanding the emotions of others, and is able to sense changes in tension and atmosphere in the group. Despite this, Mizuki tends to keep their distance, keeping their true feelings and secrets hidden from even their close friends. They have a strong recognition of the struggles their fellow members face, yet fear that they won't be accepted if they're too open about themself. It seems that they stay secretive, to an extent, from an understanding that everyone has things they want to keep hidden.
Akiyama (暁山): Aki (暁) means "dawn, sunrise", and Yama (山) means "mountain".

Mizuki (瑞希): Mizu (瑞) means "congratulations", while Ki (希) means "hope". It is a unisex name.

Mizuki's username, Amia, comes from the villain of a magical girl anime Mizuki likes, named Mia.
